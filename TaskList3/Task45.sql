Task 45. The Tiger noticed strange changes in the value of his private mice ration (see Task 
42).  He  was  not  worried  about  the  positive  changes  but  those  in  the  negative  were,  in  his 
opinion, inadmissible. So he motivated one of his spies to act and thanks to this he discovered 
Nice's  evil  practices  (Task  42).  So  he  instructed  his  computer  scientist  to  construct  a 
mechanism which would write in the Extra_additions relation (see Lectures - part 2)  -10 mice 
for  each  Nice  (minus  ten)  when  changing  to  plus  any  of  the  Nice  mice  ration  made  by  an 
operator  other  than  he  himself.  Propose  such  a  mechanism,  in  lieu  of  the computer  scientist. 
In  the  solution  use  the  LOGIN_USER  function  (which  returns  the  user  name  activating  the 
trigger) and elements of dynamic SQL.
