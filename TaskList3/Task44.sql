/*
Task  44.  The  tiger  was  concerned  about  the  inexplicable  reduction  in  mice  supplies.  So  he 
decided to introduce a head tax that would top up the pantry. So he ordered that every cat is 
obliged  to  donate  5%  (rounded  up)  of  their  total  mice  income.  In  addition,  from  what  will 
remain: 
− cats without subordinates give two mice for their incompetence during 
− applying for promotion, 
− cats without enemies give one mouse for too much agreeableness, 
− cats pay an additional tax, the form of which is determined by the contractor of the task. 
Write a function whose parameter is the cat's nickname, determining the cat's head tax due. 
This function together with the procedure from the Task 40 should be included in the one 
package and then used to determine the tax for all cats.
