Task 42. Female cats with function Nice decided to take care of their maters. So they hired IT 
to enter the virus into the Tiger's system. Now, with every attempt to change the mice ration 
for Nice for a plus (for minus there is no question at all) by a value less than 10% of the mice 
ration  of  Tiger,  the  regret  of  Nice  caused  by  this  must  be  comforted  by  an  increase  of  their 
ration  by  this  value  as  well  as  an  increase  in  extra  mice  by  5.  Additionally,  Tiger  is  to  be 
punished by the loss of these 10%. However, if the increase is satisfactory for Nice, the Tiger 
ration extra of mice is to increase by 5. 
 
Propose  two  solutions  of  this  task  that  will  bypass  the  basic  limitation  for  a  row  trigger 
activated  by  a  DML  command,  i.e.  the  inability  to  read  or  change  the  relation  on  which  the 
operation  (DML  command)  activates  this  trigger.  In  the  first  (classic)  solution,  use  several 
triggers  and  memory  in  the  form  of  a  package  specification  dedicated  to  the  task,  in  the 
second, use the COMPOUND trigger. 
 
Provide examples of how triggers work, and then remove any changes they make.
