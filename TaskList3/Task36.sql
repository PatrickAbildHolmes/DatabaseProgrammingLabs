Task  36.  Due  to  the  high  efficiency  in  hunting  mice,  SZEFUNIO  decided  to  reward  his 
subordinates.  So  he  announced  that  he  increases  the  individual  mice  ration  of  each  cat  by 
10%,  in  order  from  the  cat  with  the  lowest  ration  to  the  cat  with  the  highest  ration.  He  also 
determined that the process of increasing the mice rations should be completed when the sum 
of all rations of all cats exceeds 1050. If for a cat, the mouse ration after the increase exceeds 
the  maximum  value  due  to  the  function  (max_mice  from  the  Functions  relation),  the  mouse 
allocation after the increase should be equal to this value (max_mice). Write a PL/SQL block 
with  a  cursor  that  performs  this  task.  The  block  is  to  operate  until  the  sum  of  all  rations 
actually  exceeds  1050  (the  number  of  "increase  cycles"  may  be  greater  than  1  and  thus  the 
individual increase may be greater than 10%). Display the sum of mouse rations on the screen 
after completing the task along with the number of modifications in the Cats relation. Finally, 
roll back all changes. 
 Total ration 1057  Changes – 30
