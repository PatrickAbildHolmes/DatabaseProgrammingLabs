/*
Task 47. Define schema of the cats database in  a relational-object form.  Propose and define 
examples  of  methods  for  each  object  type.  Reference  bindings  should  be  defined  using 
reference types. Fill relations from such a scheme with data from the reality of cats and then 
perform  sample  SQL  queries,  using  references  (as  joins),  subqueries,  grouping  and  methods 
defined  within  types.  One  own  example  of  task  and  query  resolving  this  task  should  be 
provided  for  each  mechanism  (reference,  subquery,  grouping).  Additionally,  under  this  new 
database  scheme,  two  selected  non-trivial  tasks  from  list  2  and  two  from  list  3  are  to  be 
carried out.
